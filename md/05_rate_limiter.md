### üí¨ **Simulation ‚Äì 10 Interactions**

**Interviewer (Q1):**
Suppose our trading gateway must not process more than 100 requests per second from any single client. How would you design a **rate limiter** for this?

**Interviewee (A1):**
I‚Äôd start with a **token bucket** or **leaky bucket** algorithm. For example, a token bucket refills tokens at a constant rate (100 per second), and each incoming request consumes one token. If no tokens are available, the request is rejected or delayed. This naturally enforces the rate.

---

**Interviewer (Q2):**
Good. How would you implement that in a **multithreaded environment** where multiple threads may call `allowRequest()` concurrently?

**Interviewee (A2):**
I‚Äôd protect the shared state (current token count and last refill timestamp) with a **mutex** or an atomic compare‚Äëand‚Äëswap loop. Each `allowRequest()` would lock, recalculate available tokens, update state, and return. Alternatively, I could use lock‚Äëfree techniques with atomics and time calculations.

---

**Interviewer (Q3):**
Let‚Äôs say you use a mutex. Isn‚Äôt that a potential bottleneck under high load?

**Interviewee (A3):**
Yes, a single global mutex can serialize all requests. To reduce contention, we can:

* Use **sharding**: each client has its own bucket and lock.
* Or use **Read‚ÄëWrite locks** if many reads and fewer writes.
* Or implement a **lock-free token update** with atomics and double‚Äëchecked logic.

---

**Interviewer (Q4):**
Imagine this bucket needs to reset tokens every second. How do you handle that without spawning a dedicated timer thread?

**Interviewee (A4):**
I‚Äôd handle it lazily: every time `allowRequest()` is called, I compute the elapsed time since the last update, calculate how many tokens to add (based on refill rate), and update the state before checking tokens. No timer thread needed.

---

**Interviewer (Q5):**
How do you ensure **thread safety** for that lazy refill logic?

**Interviewee (A5):**
When doing lazy refill, I wrap the ‚Äúread timestamp, compute new tokens, update state‚Äù sequence in a critical section (mutex lock or atomic CAS) so that only one thread updates the refill at a time. Others will see the updated state after.

---

**Interviewer (Q6):**
Suppose we need a **non-blocking** solution. Any ideas?

**Interviewee (A6):**
I could use an **atomic variable** for tokens and a **timestamp**. In a loop, each thread would:

* Read current tokens and time.
* Compute expected new token count.
* Use `compare_exchange_weak` to update state.
* If CAS fails, retry.
  This avoids a blocking lock but is trickier to get right.

---

**Interviewer (Q7):**
What about **fairness**? Suppose many threads are waiting‚Äîhow do you ensure no thread starves?

**Interviewee (A7):**
A token bucket doesn‚Äôt inherently guarantee fairness; fast threads may grab tokens first. To improve fairness, we could:

* Queue requests (like a semaphore with FIFO).
* Or use a **blocking bounded queue** behind the limiter so requests are served in arrival order.

---

**Interviewer (Q8):**
If you had to implement this in C++ for production, what libraries or primitives would you use?

**Interviewee (A8):**
I‚Äôd use `std::mutex` and `std::chrono` for a first version. For higher performance, consider `std::atomic` for token count and `std::steady_clock` for timestamps. I might also wrap the logic in a reusable class `RateLimiter`.

---

**Interviewer (Q9):**
Let‚Äôs say the rate changes dynamically (e.g., 100 req/s ‚Üí 500 req/s). How would you handle that without stopping the system?

**Interviewee (A9):**
I‚Äôd store `maxTokens` and `refillRate` in atomics so they can be updated safely at runtime. On each `allowRequest()`, use the current atomic values to compute refill and capacity.

---

**Interviewer (Q10):**
Finally, what tests would you run to ensure your implementation works under concurrency?

**Interviewee (A10):**
I‚Äôd write:

* **Unit tests** for single-thread correctness (edge cases like full bucket, empty bucket).
* **Stress tests** with many threads calling `allowRequest()` concurrently to ensure no more than N requests are allowed.
* **Latency tests** to verify minimal overhead.
* **Dynamic config tests** for rate changes at runtime.
