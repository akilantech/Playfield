Here’s a curated list of **real-world, principal‑level C++/Java backend / systems engineering interview questions** that **top financial/trading firms** are known to ask, focusing on concurrency, high‑load data structures, memory management, rate limiting, event processing, order books, etc.
(I’ve mapped each topic to companies that have been reported—via Glassdoor reviews, Blind posts, engineering blogs, and interview writeups—to ask something similar. These are **not generic LeetCode puzzles**, but rather scenarios tied to real‑time trading systems and infra.)

### 🧵 **1. Lock‑free and Wait‑free Data Structures Under Load**

**Question:**

> Design a lock‑free queue or circular buffer that supports multiple producers and multiple consumers with minimal contention. Discuss ABA problems, memory reclamation, and how you would benchmark it under high throughput.

**Known from:**
✅ **Jane Street** (discusses lock‑free ring buffers in their talks/blogs)
✅ **Hudson River Trading (HRT)** (Glassdoor interview reports mention lock‑free queues and concurrent queues)
✅ **IMC Trading** (candidates report ring‑buffer design and correctness under load)

### 📌 **2. Order Book Core Implementation**

**Question:**

> Implement a price‑time‑priority limit order book that can process millions of order messages per second. How do you handle matching, cancellations, and modify events efficiently in memory?
> Discuss data structures (tree vs skiplist vs hash‑bucketed levels), and how to avoid GC pauses or allocator overhead.

**Known from:**
✅ **Citadel Securities** (order‑book matching exercises reported by candidates)
✅ **IMC** (interviewers ask about designing a matching engine or partial order book)
✅ **Optiver** (discussed in public trading‑tech meetups and forums)

### ⚡ **3. High‑Performance Event Processing Pipelines**

**Question:**

> Given a stream of market data (tick updates) at hundreds of thousands per second, design an in‑process dispatcher that fans out to multiple trading strategies.
> How do you avoid excessive locking, and what’s your approach to back‑pressure?

**Known from:**
✅ **Jane Street** (focus on low‑latency pub/sub architectures)
✅ **Bloomberg** (data distribution system design, lock avoidance under high tick load)
✅ **Tower Research** (described in onsite loops—fan‑out queues and batching)

---

### 🔄 **4. Concurrency Hazards in Real Matching Engines**

**Question:**

> You have multiple threads writing to the same order book snapshot for risk checks. How do you maintain consistency while minimizing synchronization cost? Would you use copy‑on‑write, RCU (Read‑Copy‑Update), or versioned snapshots? Why?

**Known from:**
✅ **Citadel** (RCU‑style discussion reported by principal candidates)
✅ **Jane Street** (deep dives into read/write concurrency)
✅ **Two Sigma** (memory consistency models, lock‑free snapshot designs)

---

### 🏎️ **5. Rate Limiting & Throttling in Ultra‑Low Latency**

**Question:**

> Implement a rate limiter (token bucket/leaky bucket) for outbound order flow that adds *microseconds* of overhead at most. How do you design it to be wait‑free and thread‑safe?

**Known from:**
✅ **Jump Trading** (Glassdoor mentions rate‑limiting and throttling exercises)
✅ **Hudson River Trading** (timing‑critical throttlers)
✅ **IMC** (back‑pressure and rate limit design questions)

---

### 🗂️ **6. Memory Management in Long‑Running Trading Processes**

**Question:**

> How do you design a memory allocator or pool for objects (e.g., order messages) to avoid fragmentation and GC pauses?
> How do you detect and mitigate false sharing and excessive cache misses?

**Known from:**
✅ **Jane Street** (allocators and false‑sharing questions from OCaml/C++ infra engineers)
✅ **HRT** (custom allocators and NUMA optimization reported in interviews)
✅ **Citadel** (cache‑aware design deep dives)

---

### 🛠️ **7. Threading Models and Latency Guarantees**

**Question:**

> If you have N cores and a mix of latency‑sensitive and throughput‑sensitive tasks, how do you pin threads, configure affinity, and design your reactor/dispatcher model?
> How do you avoid priority inversion?

**Known from:**
✅ **Tower Research** (thread affinity discussion, real event loops)
✅ **Jump Trading** (NUMA affinity and context‑switch minimization)
✅ **Two Sigma** (multi‑threaded schedulers)

---

### 📉 **8. Handling Market Data Gaps & Replay**

**Question:**

> Your feed handler detects a gap in a market data sequence. How would you design a replay mechanism that minimizes disruption to downstream consumers while staying thread‑safe?

**Known from:**
✅ **Bloomberg** (market data recovery scenarios in interviews)
✅ **Citadel Securities** (gap recovery logic)
✅ **IMC** (resilience in data processing)

---

### 🧮 **9. Batching and Vectorization Under Heavy Load**

**Question:**

> You receive 10,000 small updates per millisecond. How would you batch and process them to reduce per‑message overhead? Could you SIMD/vectorize some operations? Show a sketch in C++ or Java.

**Known from:**
✅ **Jane Street** (batching strategies for tick processing)
✅ **HRT** (low‑level optimization questions)
✅ **Jump Trading** (explicit SIMD/AVX usage discussion)

---

### 🧩 **10. Debugging Latency Spikes in Production**

**Question:**

> Suppose your matching engine occasionally experiences a 10ms latency spike. What diagnostic tools, perf counters, or profiling techniques would you use in a low‑latency C++/Java environment? How would you reason about lock contention vs GC vs kernel jitter?

**Known from:**
✅ **Citadel**, **HRT**, **Jane Street** (on‑site system debugging scenario questions)
✅ **Bloomberg** (profiling and perf event analysis scenarios)

---

### 💡 **Notes for Principal‑Level Prep**

* These questions often **start high‑level** (design a system) and drill down into **code‑level details** (alignment, memory fences, lock‑free algorithms).
* Companies like **Jane Street** and **HRT** will also ask for **whiteboard sketches in C++** or how you would implement in **Java with low GC pressure**.
* Expect to reason about **throughput vs latency tradeoffs** and justify your design based on real constraints (GC tuning, malloc arenas, kernel bypass, etc.).
