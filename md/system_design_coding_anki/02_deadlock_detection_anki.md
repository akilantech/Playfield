## How would you model a system for deadlock detection with N processes and M resource types?

* Represent the system using:
  * **Allocation matrix** `Alloc[N][M]`: Indicates how many instances of each resource each process currently holds.
  * **Request matrix** `Req[N][M]`: Indicates how many instances of each resource each process is still waiting for.
  * **Available vector** `Avail[M]`: Indicates how many instances of each resource are free.
* This model captures the current state of resource allocation and requests, enabling analysis for potential deadlocks.

**Answer:** Use an allocation matrix, request matrix, and available vector to represent resource holdings, requests, and availability, respectively.

## How can you detect a deadlock using the system model?

* Use a matrix-based deadlock detection algorithm:
  1. Initialize `Work = Avail` and a boolean array `Finish[N]` set to `false` for processes with outstanding requests.
  2. Find a process `P` where `Finish[P] == false` and `Req[P] <= Work` (component-wise).
  3. If found, simulate P finishing by adding its allocated resources to `Work` (`Work += Alloc[P]`) and set `Finish[P] = true`.
  4. Repeat until no such process exists.
  5. If any `Finish[i]` remains `false`, those processes are deadlocked.
* This simulates resource allocation to check if all processes can complete.

**Answer:** Use a matrix-based algorithm to simulate resource allocation, identifying processes that cannot finish as deadlocked.

---

## Why does the deadlock detection algorithm ensure safety?

* The algorithm checks if a process’s request can be satisfied by available resources (`Req[P] ≤ Work`).
* If satisfied, the process can finish, releasing its resources, which are added to `Work`.
* If all processes can finish, the system is safe; otherwise, processes with `Finish[i] = false` are deadlocked.
* This ensures no process is falsely marked as deadlocked if a valid execution sequence exists.

**Answer:** It simulates resource allocation to verify if all processes can complete, identifying deadlocks when no sequence exists.

---

## What does it mean if `Finish[2]` and `Finish[4]` are false after the deadlock detection algorithm?

* Processes 2 and 4 are part of a **deadlock cycle**.
* They hold resources and are waiting for resources held by others in the cycle, preventing progress.
* No sequence of resource allocations allows these processes to complete.

**Answer:** Processes 2 and 4 are deadlocked, forming a cycle where each waits for resources held by others.

---

## How frequently should deadlock detection run in a high-frequency trading system, and why?

* Run detection **on-demand** when a process waits abnormally long to minimize latency overhead.
* Alternatively, run **periodically** (e.g., every few seconds) if deadlocks are rare but acceptable to detect.
* In trading systems, on-demand is preferred to avoid impacting critical performance.

**Answer:** Prefer on-demand detection triggered by long waits to minimize overhead in latency-sensitive trading systems.

---

## What actions can be taken after detecting a deadlock in a trading system?

* Log and alert the issue for monitoring.
* Abort or preempt one or more deadlocked processes to break the cycle.
* Cancel non-critical operations or restart a worker to resolve the deadlock.

**Answer:** Log, alert, abort processes, or cancel operations to break the deadlock cycle.

---

## What is the difference between deadlock prevention, avoidance, and detection?

* **Prevention:** Design the system to eliminate one deadlock condition (e.g., enforce global lock acquisition order).
* **Avoidance:** Use algorithms like Banker’s to ensure safe resource allocation, avoiding unsafe states.
* **Detection:** Allow deadlocks but periodically check and recover (e.g., using the matrix-based algorithm).
* Trading systems often combine prevention (lock ordering) with detection as a safety net.

**Answer:** Prevention eliminates deadlock conditions, avoidance ensures safe allocations, and detection identifies and resolves deadlocks.

## How do fine-grained locks affect deadlock likelihood in a trading system?

* Fine-grained locks reduce contention by allowing more granular access to resources.
* This lowers the chance of circular wait conditions, reducing deadlock likelihood.
* Combined with consistent lock acquisition order, it further minimizes deadlocks.

**Answer:** Fine-grained locks decrease deadlock likelihood by reducing contention and circular waits.

---

## Which is NOT one of the four necessary conditions for a deadlock?

* **Mutual exclusion**: Resources must be held exclusively.
* **Hold and wait**: Processes hold resources while waiting for others.
* **No preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken.
* **Circular wait**: Processes form a cycle waiting for each other’s resources.
* **First-come, first-serve scheduling** is not a deadlock condition.

**Answer:** D) First-come, first-serve scheduling

## What does it mean if `Finish[i]` remains false after the deadlock detection algorithm?

* **A) Process i has completed execution**: Incorrect, as `Finish[i] = true` indicates completion.
* **B) Process i is part of a deadlock cycle**: Correct, as it cannot proceed due to unsatisfied requests.
* **C) Process i has no allocated resources**: Incorrect, as allocation is irrelevant if requests cannot be met.
* **D) Process i has no pending requests**: Incorrect, as `Finish[i] = false` implies pending requests.

**Answer:** B) Process i is part of a deadlock cycle

---

## What does the `Request` matrix represent in the system model?

* **A) Resources currently held by each process**: Incorrect, this is the `Allocation` matrix.
* **B) Resources each process still needs to complete**: Correct, it shows pending resource requests.
* **C) Total resources available in the system**: Incorrect, this is the `Available` vector.
* **D) Maximum resources each process can hold**: Incorrect, not part of the model.

**Answer:** B) Resources each process still needs to complete

## Which strategy is an example of deadlock prevention?

* **A) Running a detection algorithm periodically**: Incorrect, this is detection.
* **B) Enforcing a global lock acquisition order**: Correct, it prevents circular wait.
* **C) Aborting a process when a deadlock is detected**: Incorrect, this is recovery.
* **D) Using the Banker’s algorithm to avoid unsafe states**: Incorrect, this is avoidance.

**Answer:** B) Enforcing a global lock acquisition order

## What is the Banker’s algorithm primarily used for?

* **A) Detecting deadlocks in a running system**: Incorrect, it’s for avoidance.
* **B) Preventing deadlocks by enforcing lock ordering**: Incorrect, this is prevention.
* **C) Avoiding deadlocks by ensuring safe resource allocation**: Correct, it checks for safe states.
* **D) Recovering from deadlocks by preempting resources**: Incorrect, it’s not for recovery.

**Answer:** C) Avoiding deadlocks by ensuring safe resource allocation

---

## What is a potential recovery action after detecting a deadlock in a trading system?

* **A) Increase the number of available resources**: Incorrect, often not feasible.
* **B) Abort one of the deadlocked processes**: Correct, it releases resources to break the cycle.
* **C) Change the scheduling algorithm to priority-based**: Incorrect, unrelated to recovery.
* **D) Merge all processes into a single thread**: Incorrect, impractical in trading systems.

**Answer:** B) Abort one of the deadlocked processes

---

## How do fine-grained locks affect deadlock likelihood?

* **A) Increases deadlock likelihood due to more locks**: Incorrect, more locks don’t inherently cause deadlocks.
* **B) Decreases deadlock likelihood by reducing contention**: Correct, less contention reduces circular waits.
* **C) Has no effect on deadlock likelihood**: Incorrect, granularity impacts contention.
* **D) Eliminates deadlocks entirely**: Incorrect, they reduce but don’t eliminate deadlocks.

**Answer:** B) Decreases deadlock likelihood by reducing contention

## Why prefer on-demand deadlock detection in a high-frequency trading system?

* **A) On-demand detection uses fewer resources**: Correct, it runs only when needed, minimizing overhead.
* **B) Periodic detection is too slow for real-time systems**: Incorrect, speed depends on implementation.
* **C) On-demand detection avoids false positives**: Incorrect, both can be accurate.
* **D) Periodic detection requires more locks**: Incorrect, detection doesn’t involve locks.

**Answer:** A) On-demand detection uses fewer resources

## Why do processes P1, P2, P3, and P4 form a deadlock in the example?

* **A) They have no allocated resources**: Incorrect, they hold resources.
* **B) Their requests exceed total system resources**: Incorrect, not necessarily true.
* **C) They form a circular wait for resources**: Correct, each waits for resources held by another.
* **D) They are using fine-grained locks**: Incorrect, lock granularity is unrelated.

**Answer:** C) They form a circular wait for resources

## Which approach complements deadlock detection to minimize deadlocks in a trading system?

* **A) Using a single global lock for all resources**: Incorrect, increases contention.
* **B) Implementing a timeout mechanism for resource requests**: Correct, it breaks potential cycles.
* **C) Increasing the number of resource types**: Incorrect, may increase complexity.
* **D) Running detection algorithms more frequently**: Incorrect, doesn’t prevent deadlocks.

**Answer:** B) Implementing a timeout mechanism for resource requests
