## What is the primary purpose of using a thread-safe queue in an Async Event Processor with multiple producers and a single consumer?

* Ensure events are processed in the order they are submitted
* Maintain FIFO order using a thread-safe queue
* Allow multiple producers to submit events concurrently
* Not to eliminate the consumer thread or reduce memory

## Which synchronization primitive is most commonly used to notify a consumer thread when new events are available in a queue?

* `std::condition_variable` for signaling new events
* Not `std::mutex` (locks, doesnâ€™t notify)
* Not `std::atomic` (for atomic operations, not signaling)
* Not `std::lock_guard` (for locking scope, not notification)

## What is backpressure in the context of an Async Event Processor, and how can it be managed?

* Producers submitting events faster than the consumer can process
* Managed with a bounded queue to limit size
* Blocks producers or drops events when queue is full
* Not overloading consumer with threads or memory leaks

## What is a key advantage of using a lock-free queue over a mutex-protected queue in a high-throughput system?

* Reduces contention and improves performance under high concurrency
* Not guaranteeing strict ordering across multiple consumers
* Not simplifying shutdown or eliminating condition variables
* Improves latency but increases complexity

## How can a graceful shutdown be ensured in an Async Event Processor?

* Process all queued events before stopping the consumer thread
* Set stop flag and notify consumer to drain queue
* Not terminate consumer immediately or clear queue
* Not pause producers for user input

## What is a potential risk of using an unbounded queue in an Async Event Processor?

* Uncontrolled memory growth if producers outpace consumer
* Not increased contention or loss of ordering
* Not deadlocks from condition variable misuse
* Can lead to system crashes due to memory exhaustion

## How should exceptions during event processing be handled to ensure the consumer thread remains operational?

* Catch exceptions in consumer loop and log them
* Continue processing next event after exception
* Not terminate consumer or propagate to producers
* Not ignore or retry the same event

## What challenge arises with event ordering if an Async Event Processor is extended to multiple consumer threads?

* Multiple consumers may process events out of sequence
* Requires coordination or partitioning for ordering
* Not producers submitting out of order
* Not automatic reordering or deadlocks

## What is a key benefit of using a bounded queue with blocking behavior for producers?

* Prevents memory exhaustion by limiting queue size
* Forces producers to block or handle overflow
* Not guaranteeing fixed-time processing
* Not eliminating synchronization needs

## What is an effective way to test the correctness of an Async Event Processor implementation?

* Stress test with multiple producers to verify ordering
* Test shutdown to ensure all events are processed
* Use tools to detect deadlocks or race conditions
* Not just single producer or empty queue tests

## How does an Async Event Processor ensure event processing order with multiple producers?

* Uses a single consumer thread with a FIFO queue
* Queue preserves insertion order from producers
* Not dependent on producer coordination
* Ensures sequential processing by consumer

## What happens if `submit()` is called after `stop()` in an Async Event Processor?

* Check `stopFlag` in `submit()` to reject new events
* Throw an exception or log an error
* Not allow submission to proceed
* Prevents race conditions post-shutdown

## How would you adapt an Async Event Processor for multiple consumers?

* Use a thread pool pulling from the same queue
* Ordering not guaranteed without partitioning
* Route events by key to specific worker queues
* Increases throughput but adds complexity

## What is a lock-free alternative to a mutex and condition variable in an Async Event Processor?

* Use a lock-free queue like `boost::lockfree::queue`
* Consumer spins or uses a wait strategy
* Improves latency under high contention
* More complex to implement than mutex-based

## What is a Python implementation of an Async Event Processor?

* Uses threading with a lock-protected queue
* Single consumer processes events in order
* Supports graceful shutdown and exception handling
* Below is a Python solution with example usage
