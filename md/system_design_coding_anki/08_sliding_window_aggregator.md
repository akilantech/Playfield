## What are all the problems can be solved using sliding window aggregation
-- There are several real-world problems in financial technology that initially appear complex, demanding high throughput, tight latency, and strict resource management, but are actually elegantly solved using the simple **sliding window aggregator** and **monotonic queue** techniques described above. Below are some classic examples:

## 1. **Rolling Market Metrics (Price, Volume, Volatility)**
- **Problem:** “Show me the rolling maximum stock price in the last 15 minutes” or “Detect real-time volume spikes as new trades arrive.”
- **Perceived Complexity:** A naive approach might require storing all data and rescanning for every new tick, seeming memory/CPU-intensive.
- **Simple Solution:** Use sliding window max/min and sum via a monotonic deque and rolling sum—O(1) per operation—memory bounded to window size.

## 2. **Fraud Detection (Rule-Based Triggers)**
- **Problem:** “Block accounts that withdraw more than $10,000 cumulatively within any 10-minute period.”
- **Perceived Complexity:** Detecting breaching of thresholds in a moving time window feels expensive, especially at scale.
- **Simple Solution:** Use a sliding window sum aggregator keyed by account: continuously add new withdrawals, expire out-of-window events, and trigger on sum.

## 3. **Real-Time Risk Exposure**
- **Problem:** “Show the maximum notional exposure of a trading book in the last hour” or “Track variance of P&L over rolling timeframes.”
- **Perceived Complexity:** These require real-time stats and the potential for large data volume.
- **Simple Solution:** With a sliding aggregator, maintain rolling max/min/variance over required time/count windows.

## 4. **Throttle or Rate Limiters**
- **Problem:** “Reject or flag users sending more than X trades/requests in last Y seconds.”
- **Perceived Complexity:** Handling thousands of users with millions of events in a distributed way seems daunting.
- **Simple Solution:** For each key/user, a count-based sliding window (deque) efficiently records recent activity and enforces policies.

## 5. **Latency-Sensitive Event Detection**
- **Problem:** “Alert if the spread between bid and ask widens beyond a threshold in the last N quotes.”
- **Perceived Complexity:** Maintaining rolling stats in high-frequency data streams often involves complicated, slow, or unbounded computations.
- **Simple Solution:** Use a count-based sliding window (deque) for fast, rolling aggregate, providing instant alerting with bounded memory.

## 6. **Real-Time Analytics Dashboards**
- **Problem:** “Visualize statistics (rolling averages, min/max, counts) of trades/orders at sub-second granularity.”
- **Perceived Complexity:** Supporting sub-second granularity feels like it requires heavy pre-aggregation or special databases.
- **Simple Solution:** Sliding window aggregators power widgets—each chart/query operates on windowed, bounded data with O(1) updates.

## Why Do These Problems Seem Tricky?

- They're **streaming** and high-frequency (naive designs suggest expensive full scans).
- Require **recency** (time or count-based freshness).
- Need **low latency** and **bounded memory**.
- Involve **concurrent producers** (e.g., multiple market data or transaction feeds).

## Why Are They Actually Simple?

- All reduce to **window-bounded aggregates**: sum, count, min, max, mean, etc.
- Sliding window + monotonic queue (deque) structures offer **optimal O(1) solutions with fixed memory**.
- Easy to implement, thread-safe, and scale with sharding.

**Key Insight:**  
Many “tricky-looking” problems in fintech—whether for risk, fraud, analytics, regulatory compliance, or trading—can be mapped to a simple sliding window aggregation, making design, implementation, and reasoning clear and efficient.


## 🧠 **Problem Name:** Sliding Window Aggregator

### 📌 **Definition:**

Design a system component that efficiently computes **aggregate metrics** (e.g., sum, max, average, min) over a **sliding window** of time or events from a high-frequency stream of `(timestamp, value)` data.

This system must:

* **Support time-based windows**, such as “last 5 seconds”
* **Support count-based windows**, such as “last 1000 events”
* Maintain **O(1) or amortized O(1) operations**
* Be **memory-efficient**, bounded to the sliding window
* Handle **concurrent updates** from multiple producers

## 🏦 **Context:** - Sliding Window Aggregator

In fintech, banking, and trading systems, real-time data processing is crucial for applications like:

* **Market data analytics** (e.g., compute rolling max price, rolling volatility)
* **Risk systems** (e.g., real-time exposure calculations)
* **Fraud detection** (e.g., sum of large withdrawals in past 10 minutes)
* **Trading engines** (e.g., detecting recent volume spikes)

Such systems ingest a continuous stream of timestamped events (e.g., trades, orders, account activities), and need to compute rolling aggregates with **strict latency and memory constraints**. This makes naive scanning or unbounded accumulation infeasible.
