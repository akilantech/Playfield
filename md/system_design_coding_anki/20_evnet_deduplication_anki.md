## What is the primary purpose of event deduplication in a high-frequency trading system?

* Prevent processing duplicate events to avoid redundant trades
* Ensure accurate market state by filtering repeated data
* Reduce system load and improve latency

## Which data structure is most suitable for efficient event deduplication?

* Hash set for O(1) lookup and insertion
* Stores event signatures (e.g., hash of event data)
* Minimizes lookup time for high-frequency events

## How can you generate a unique signature for an event in a deduplication system?

* Hash event fields (e.g., timestamp, symbol, price)
* Use a cryptographic hash like SHA-256 for uniqueness
* Ensures consistent identification of duplicates

## What is a key challenge in event deduplication for high-frequency trading?

* Handling high event rates without latency spikes
* Ensuring thread-safety for concurrent submissions
* Avoiding false positives in deduplication

## How can you make an event deduplicator thread-safe?

* Use a mutex to protect the hash set
* Synchronize access to prevent race conditions

## What is a potential downside of storing all event signatures indefinitely?

* Unbounded memory growth
* Requires periodic cleanup or expiry

## How can you optimize an event deduplicator for low memory usage?

* Use a time-based sliding window for signatures
* Expire old signatures after a fixed period
* Balances memory and deduplication accuracy

## What is a suitable approach to handle out-of-order events in deduplication?

* Use a sliding window based on timestamp
* Reject duplicates within the window
* Handles slight timestamp variations

## How would you test an event deduplicator under high-frequency trading conditions?

* Simulate high-rate event streams with duplicates
* Verify deduplication accuracy and latency
* Test concurrent submissions for thread-safety

## What is a common metric to evaluate an event deduplicatorâ€™s performance?

* Deduplication rate (percentage of duplicates caught)
* Latency of event processing
* Memory usage of signature storage

## How can you extend an event deduplicator to support multiple event types?

* Use a hash set per event type
* Key signatures by event type identifier
* Maintains type-specific deduplication

## What happens if the deduplication window is too small in a trading system?

* Misses duplicates outside the window
* Leads to redundant processing
* Impacts accuracy in high-frequency systems

## How does a Bloom filter improve event deduplication?

* Reduces memory usage with probabilistic structure
* Allows false positives but no false negatives

## What is a Python implementation of an event deduplicator?

* Uses a hash set with sliding window
* Thread-safe with a lock
* Hashes event fields for deduplication
* Below is a Python solution with example usage
