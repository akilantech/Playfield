## What is the primary purpose of a bit manipulation throttler in a high-frequency trading system?

* Limit request rate using minimal memory
* Track requests with bitsets for efficiency
* Prevent system overload from excessive requests

## Which data structure is most suitable for a bit manipulation throttler?

* Bitset or integer array for request tracking
* Uses bits to mark time slots
* Enables O(1) updates and checks

## How does a bit manipulation throttler track requests in a sliding window?

* Uses a bitset with bits for time slots
* Shifts bits as time window slides
* Counts set bits to check request limit

## What is a key advantage of using bit manipulation for throttling?

* Extremely low memory usage
* Fast bitwise operations for updates

## How can you make a bit manipulation throttler thread-safe?

* Use a mutex to protect bitset updates
* Synchronize access to prevent race conditions

## What is a limitation of a bit manipulation throttler with fixed-size bitsets?

* Limited to fixed time granularity
* Cannot handle arbitrary window sizes

## How can you optimize a bit manipulation throttler for high-frequency requests?

* Use coarse-grained time slots (e.g., milliseconds)
* Precompute bit shifts for performance
* Minimize locking with batch updates

## What is a challenge when scaling a bit manipulation throttler to multiple users?

* Managing separate bitsets per user
* Increases memory with many users
* Requires efficient user lookup

## How would you test a bit manipulation throttler under high load?

* Simulate high-rate requests with multiple threads
* Verify throttling accuracy and latency
* Test bitset expiry and thread-safety

## What is a suitable approach to reset a bit manipulation throttler?

* Shift bitset and clear old bits
* Use modulo for circular bitset
* Maintains sliding window semantics

## How can you extend a bit manipulation throttler for multiple rate limits?

* Use multiple bitsets per user
* Track different limits (e.g., per second, minute)
* Combine checks for composite limits

## What happens if the time slot granularity is too coarse in a bit manipulation throttler?

* Reduced precision in rate limiting
* Allows bursts within slots
* Impacts throttling accuracy

## How does a bit manipulation throttler compare to a token bucket algorithm?

* Bit manipulation uses less memory
* Token bucket allows controlled bursts
* Bit manipulation simpler for fixed rates

## What is a Python implementation of a bit manipulation throttler?

* Uses integer for bitset with sliding window
* Thread-safe with a lock
* Tracks requests in time slots
* Below is a Python solution with example usage
