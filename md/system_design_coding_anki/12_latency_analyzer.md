## What is the primary goal of a latency analyzer in a high-frequency trading system?

* Measure and analyze request processing times
* Identify performance bottlenecks
* Provide percentile-based latency metrics

## Which data structure is best for tracking latency samples with efficient percentile calculations?

* Histogram with fixed-size buckets
* Enables O(1) updates and approximate percentiles

## How can you ensure thread-safety in a latency analyzer with multiple threads?

* Use a mutex to protect shared histogram
* Synchronizing updates to shared data structure
* Avoiding contention under high load -- (TODO -- lock less (c++))


## What is a key advantage of using a histogram over a sorted list for latency analysis?

* Constant-time updates and approximate percentiles
* Avoids O(n log n) sorting for queries
* Scales better for high-frequency updates

## How can you handle high-frequency updates in a latency analyzer?

* Use fixed-size histogram buckets
* Pre-allocate memory to avoid reallocations
* Batch updates to reduce lock contention

## What is a common metric provided by a latency analyzer in trading systems?

* Percentile latencies (e.g., p99, p95, p50, min, max)
* Helps identify tail latency issues

## How can you optimize a latency analyzer for low memory usage?

* Use coarse-grained histogram buckets
* Limit bucket count based on precision needs


## How would you test a latency analyzer under realistic trading conditions?

* Simulate high-frequency requests with multiple threads
* Verify percentile accuracy and contention
* Measure overhead of latency tracking
* Stress test with beyond expected loads and check latency overhead

## What is a suitable approach to reset or snapshot latency data periodically?

* Copy histogram and reset original
* Use double-buffering for non-blocking reads:
  * Create a frozen buffer for read to separate active buffer for recording
  * Read is nonblocking as it reads from frozen buffer and does not lock active where write is happening.

## How can you compute approximate percentiles from a histogram?

* Track bucket counts and total samples
* Find bucket containing desired percentile
* Interpolate within bucket for estimate

## What happens if bucket ranges are too coarse in a latency analyzer?

* Reduced precision in percentile estimates
* Impacts accuracy of tail latencies

## How would you extend a latency analyzer to support multiple event types?

* Use separate histograms per event type
* Key histograms by event ID
* Merge for aggregate statistics

## What is a Python implementation of a latency analyzer?

* Uses a histogram with fixed buckets
* Thread-safe with a lock
* Supports percentile queries and resets
* Below is a Python solution with example usage
