## What is the primary goal of a latency analyzer in a high-frequency trading system?

* Measure and analyze request processing times
* Identify performance bottlenecks
* Provide percentile-based latency metrics
* Not to increase throughput or schedule tasks

## Which data structure is best for tracking latency samples with efficient percentile calculations?

* Histogram with fixed-size buckets
* Enables O(1) updates and approximate percentiles
* Not a sorted array or linked list
* Not a hash map for direct lookups

## How can you ensure thread-safety in a latency analyzer with multiple threads?

* Use a mutex to protect shared histogram
* Not atomic counters alone (insufficient for buckets)
* Not lock-free queues or thread-local storage
* Synchronizes updates from multiple threads

## What is a key advantage of using a histogram over a sorted list for latency analysis?

* Constant-time updates and approximate percentiles
* Avoids O(n log n) sorting for queries
* Not lower memory usage or exact percentiles
* Scales better for high-frequency updates

## How can you handle high-frequency updates in a latency analyzer?

* Use fixed-size histogram buckets
* Pre-allocate memory to avoid reallocations
* Batch updates to reduce lock contention
* Not dynamic arrays or frequent resizing

## What is a common metric provided by a latency analyzer in trading systems?

* Percentile latencies (e.g., p99, p95)
* Not average throughput or total requests
* Not memory usage or CPU utilization
* Helps identify tail latency issues

## How can you optimize a latency analyzer for low memory usage?

* Use coarse-grained histogram buckets
* Limit bucket count based on precision needs
* Not store all samples or use fine-grained buckets
* Not compress data with gzip

## What is a challenge when collecting latency samples across multiple threads?

* Synchronizing updates to shared data structure
* Avoiding contention under high load
* Not ensuring exact timestamps
* Not distributing samples across nodes

## How would you test a latency analyzer under realistic trading conditions?

* Simulate high-frequency requests with multiple threads
* Verify percentile accuracy and contention
* Measure overhead of latency tracking
* Not single-threaded or low-rate tests

## What is a suitable approach to reset or snapshot latency data periodically?

* Copy histogram and reset original
* Use double-buffering for non-blocking reads
* Not clear samples without snapshot
* Not pause threads during reset

## How can you compute approximate percentiles from a histogram?

* Track bucket counts and total samples
* Find bucket containing desired percentile
* Interpolate within bucket for estimate
* Not sort samples or use exact algorithms

## What happens if bucket ranges are too coarse in a latency analyzer?

* Reduced precision in percentile estimates
* Not increased contention or memory usage
* Not incorrect sample counts
* Impacts accuracy of tail latencies

## How would you extend a latency analyzer to support multiple event types?

* Use separate histograms per event type
* Key histograms by event ID
* Merge for aggregate statistics
* Not single histogram or sorted list

## What is a Python implementation of a latency analyzer?

* Uses a histogram with fixed buckets
* Thread-safe with a lock
* Supports percentile queries and resets
* Below is a Python solution with example usage
