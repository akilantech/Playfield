**Context:**
You are building a throttling mechanism for a high‑performance trading gateway.
You are given a stream of **N events**, each tagged with an integer `eventId` (0 ≤ eventId < 2^32).
The throttler must **allow at most K unique events** in any sliding window of size W milliseconds.
For extreme speed, you cannot use heavy data structures like `unordered_set`.
Instead, you are asked to implement a **bit‑manipulation based throttle mask**.

**Key requirements:**

1. Maintain a compact bitmap to represent recently seen events (you may hash eventId down to M bits).
2. Given a new `eventId` and current timestamp `t`, return `true` (allow) if adding it does **not** exceed K unique events in the last W ms, otherwise return `false` (drop).
3. Support up to 10 million events/second with minimal allocations.

**Design a data structure and algorithm.**

## 🎭 **Simulation: 10‑Interaction Q\&A**

**Interviewer:**
Let’s start simple. How would you represent a large set of eventIds efficiently for throttling?

**Interviewee:**
I would hash each `eventId` to a smaller range, say 0..M‑1, and use a fixed‑size bitmap. Each bit in a `uint64_t` array represents whether that hashed ID has been seen.

---

**Interviewer:**
Good. But we need a sliding window in time. How would you clear out old bits efficiently?

**Interviewee:**
We can maintain multiple bitmaps in a ring buffer indexed by time slices. For example, split W ms into S slices, each slice has its own bitmap. When time advances, we rotate and clear the expired slice.

---

**Interviewer:**
Sounds promising. How would you count unique events in the last W ms without scanning the whole bitmap?

**Interviewee:**
I’d maintain a rolling aggregate bitmap: `activeMask = OR(all bitmaps in last W)`. When we add a new slice, we OR it in; when we drop an old slice, we AND it out using bitwise operations and precomputed counts.

---

**Interviewer:**
Let’s discuss K, the limit on unique events. How do you count bits set in the mask quickly?

**Interviewee:**
Use a built‑in popcount (`__builtin_popcountll` in C++) on each 64‑bit chunk. Summation gives the unique count. This can be done efficiently because our bitmap is fixed size.

---

**Interviewer:**
What if two different eventIds hash to the same bit? Won’t that inflate the count?

**Interviewee:**
Yes, that’s a trade‑off. To mitigate, we can use a larger bitmap (e.g., 2^20 bits) or multiple hash functions like a Bloom filter variant to reduce collisions, depending on memory budget.

---

**Interviewer:**
Nice. How do you handle concurrency? Events are arriving from multiple threads.

**Interviewee:**
We can shard the bitmap per thread and merge periodically, or use atomic bitwise operations (`std::atomic<uint64_t>`) on 64‑bit segments. We’d need lock‑free updates with fetch\_or.

---

**Interviewer:**
What’s the memory footprint if you use a 2^20 bitmap with 16 slices?

**Interviewee:**
2^20 bits = 128KB per slice. 16 slices = about 2MB total. Very reasonable for an HFT throttle.

---

**Interviewer:**
How do you clear a slice when it expires without pausing traffic?

**Interviewee:**
Keep a rotating index; when a slice expires, we overwrite its bitmap with zeros in a background thread or using `memset`, then update the rolling mask by recomputing OR.

---

**Interviewer:**
Can you sketch pseudocode for `allowEvent(eventId, timestamp)`?

**Interviewee:**
Sure:

```cpp
size_t idx = hash(eventId) & (M-1);
size_t word = idx >> 6;
uint64_t bit = 1ULL << (idx & 63);
int slice = (timestamp / SLICE_MS) % NUM_SLICES;

if (!(slices[slice][word] & bit)) {
    // new in this slice
    slices[slice][word] |= bit;
    activeMask[word] |= bit;
}

if (popcount(activeMask) > K) return false;
return true;
```

---

**Interviewer:**
Great! What optimization would you add for extremely high throughput?

**Interviewee:**
Use SIMD popcount (AVX2), prefetch memory lines, and tune NUM\_SLICES to match W and latency. Also, avoid dynamic memory—use fixed arrays.

### Correct Answers and Explanations:
**Question 1: Why is bit manipulation preferred for representing event IDs in a high-performance throttling system?**  
- **Your Answer**: b) It provides a compact representation with fast operations like OR and AND.  
- **Correct Answer**: b  
- **Explanation**: Bit manipulation is ideal for high-performance systems because it uses minimal memory (e.g., one bit per event ID) and supports fast operations like OR, AND, and popcount. Option a is incorrect because bitmaps are fixed-size, not dynamic. Option c is false as hashing can still cause collisions. Option d is unrelated to bit manipulation.

**Question 2: How does splitting the sliding window into time slices improve the throttling mechanism?**  
- **Your Answer**: b) It allows for efficient clearing of old events by resetting entire slices.  
- **Correct Answer**: b  
- **Explanation**: Splitting the window into slices allows old events to be cleared by resetting an entire slice’s bitmap when it expires, which is efficient. Option a is false because timestamps are still needed. Option c is incorrect as slicing reduces memory overhead. Option d is unrelated to slicing.

**Question 3: What is a potential downside of hashing event IDs to a smaller bitmap range?**  
- **Your Answer**: b) It may cause collisions, leading to over-counting unique events.  
- **Correct Answer**: b  
- **Explanation**: Hashing to a smaller range can cause collisions, where different event IDs map to the same bit, inflating the unique event count. Option a is false as bitmaps are memory-efficient. Option c is incorrect because bitwise operations are still used. Option d is unrelated to hashing.

**Question 4: What is the most efficient way to count unique events in a bitmap using bit manipulation?**  
- **Your Answer**: b) Use a built-in population count function like `__builtin_popcountll`.  
- **Correct Answer**: b  
- **Explanation**: Built-in functions like `__builtin_popcountll` are highly optimized for counting set bits in a 64-bit word. Option a is slower due to manual iteration. Option c is inefficient as converting to a set negates the bitmap’s benefits. Option d is irrelevant as binary search doesn’t apply.

**Question 5: How can a rolling aggregate bitmap (activeMask) be updated when a time slice expires?**  
- **Your Answer**: b) Use a bitwise AND to remove the expired slice’s bits from the aggregate.  
- **Correct Answer**: b  
- **Explanation**: To update `activeMask`, you can use a bitwise AND with the inverse of the expired slice’s bitmap to clear its bits. Option a is inefficient as it requires rescanning events. Option c loses all data. Option d doesn’t update the bitmap.

**Question 6: What is a suitable approach to handle concurrent event processing in a bit-based throttler?**  
- **Your Answer**: b) Shard bitmaps per thread and merge periodically.  
- **Correct Answer**: b  
- **Explanation**: Sharding bitmaps per thread reduces contention, and periodic merging maintains accuracy. Option a (global lock) slows performance. Option c avoids concurrency, which isn’t scalable. Option d introduces unnecessary complexity.

**Question 7: If a bitmap uses 2^20 bits and 16 time slices, what is the approximate memory footprint?**  
- **Your Answer**: d) 1 GB  
- **Correct Answer**: b) 2 MB  
- **Explanation**: A 2^20-bit bitmap = 1,048,576 bits = 128 KB (since 1 byte = 8 bits, 1,048,576 / 8 = 131,072 bytes). With 16 slices: 128 KB × 16 = 2 MB. Your answer (1 GB) significantly overestimates the footprint. For reference:  
  - 2^20 bits = 128 KB per slice.  
  - 16 slices × 128 KB = 2,048 KB ≈ 2 MB.  
  - 1 GB (2^30 bytes) is far too large for this setup.

**Question 8: Which optimization is most effective for achieving high throughput in a bit-based throttler?**  
- **Your Answer**: b) Leverage SIMD instructions for popcount operations.  
- **Correct Answer**: b  
- **Explanation**: SIMD instructions (e.g., AVX2 for popcount) can process multiple 64-bit words in parallel, boosting throughput. Option a increases overhead. Option c adds complexity without speed gains. Option d risks memory and latency issues.

**Question 9: How can the impact of hash collisions be mitigated in a bit-based throttler?**  
- **Your Answer**: b) Implement a Bloom filter-like approach with multiple hash functions.  
- **Correct Answer**: b  
- **Explanation**: Using multiple hash functions (like a Bloom filter) reduces collision probability by spreading event IDs across more bits. Option a helps but is less effective than multiple hashes. Option c is impractical due to memory. Option d destroys the sliding window.

**Question 10: What is an efficient way to clear an expired time slice without pausing event processing?**  
- **Your Answer**: a) Use a background thread to reset the slice with zeros.  
- **Correct Answer**: a  
- **Explanation**: A background thread can clear an expired slice (e.g., using `memset`) without blocking the main event-processing thread. Option b pauses traffic, which is undesirable. Option c risks data corruption. Option d is inefficient due to allocation overhead.
