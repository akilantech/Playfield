##  **Context**

> **Problem:**
> Implement a simplified `SharedPtr<T>` from scratch.
> Requirements:
>
> * Manage the lifetime of a heapâ€‘allocated object of type `T`.
> * Reference counting (threadâ€‘safe not required, but you must justify tradeâ€‘offs).
> * Implement `operator*`, `operator->`, copy constructor, assignment, destructor.
> * Show how you would handle `use_count()`, `reset()`, and edge cases (selfâ€‘assignment, nullptr).
> * You are **not allowed to use `std::shared_ptr` or `std::unique_ptr` internally.**

### **Interaction**
**Interviewer (I)** and **Candidate (C)**
---

**1. I:**
At Jane Street or Morgan Stanley, we care about controlling object lifetimes under load.
Can you explain what a smart pointer is and why we need one instead of raw `T*`?

**C:**
Sure. A smart pointer is a C++ class that wraps a raw pointer and manages the resourceâ€™s lifecycle automaticallyâ€”most commonly by reference counting or unique ownership.
Instead of manually `delete`â€‘ing memory, the smart pointer deletes the managed object when itâ€™s no longer referenced, avoiding leaks and doubleâ€‘frees.

---

**2. I:**
Good. Letâ€™s say we need our own `SharedPtr<T>`. Whatâ€™s the minimal data members youâ€™d include?

**C:**
Weâ€™d need:

* A `T* ptr_` to hold the raw pointer,
* An `int* refCount_` to keep track of how many `SharedPtr` objects share ownership.

---

**3. I:**
Walk me through your copy constructor logic.

**C:**
When copying, Iâ€™d:

* Copy `ptr_` and `refCount_` from the source,
* Increment `(*refCount_)` since we have an additional owner.

---

**4. I:**
And destructor?

**C:**
On destruction:

* Decrement `(*refCount_)`,
* If it reaches zero, `delete ptr_` and `delete refCount_`.

---

**5. I:**
How about assignment operator? Any traps?

**C:**
Yes:

* Check for selfâ€‘assignment,
* Decrement the old ref count (and free if needed),
* Copy `ptr_` and `refCount_` from the rightâ€‘hand side,
* Increment the new `refCount_`.

---

**6. I:**
What about `reset()`? How would you implement that?

**C:**
`reset()` would:

* Decrement the current ref count (delete if zero),
* Point `ptr_` to `nullptr` and `refCount_` to a fresh count if we want to manage a new object, otherwise leave them null.

---

**7. I:**
Can your design handle `SharedPtr<int> p(nullptr);`?

**C:**
Yes, Iâ€™d initialize `ptr_` to `nullptr` and `refCount_` to a valid `new int(1)` or simply set `refCount_ = nullptr` and guard operations (like dereference) accordingly.

---

**8. I:**
Suppose two `SharedPtr` instances manage the same raw pointer but with different control blocks. What happens?

**C:**
Thatâ€™s undefined behavior and breaks the design. A smart pointer must **always share the same control block** (i.e., `refCount_`). My implementation only shares ownership when constructed or assigned from another `SharedPtr`, not arbitrary raw pointers.

---

**9. I:**
Can you sketch the core implementation for me?

**C:**
Sure, hereâ€™s the skeleton:

```cpp
template<typename T>
class SharedPtr {
    T* ptr_;
    int* refCount_;
public:
    explicit SharedPtr(T* p = nullptr)
        : ptr_(p), refCount_(p ? new int(1) : nullptr) {}

    SharedPtr(const SharedPtr& other)
        : ptr_(other.ptr_), refCount_(other.refCount_) {
        if (refCount_) ++(*refCount_);
    }

    SharedPtr& operator=(const SharedPtr& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            release();
            ptr_ = other.ptr_;
            refCount_ = other.refCount_;
            if (refCount_) ++(*refCount_);
        }
        return *this;
    }

    ~SharedPtr() { release(); }

    void release() {
        if (refCount_ && --(*refCount_) == 0) {
            delete ptr_;
            delete refCount_;
        }
    }

    T& operator*() const { return *ptr_; }
    T* operator->() const { return ptr_; }
    int use_count() const { return refCount_ ? *refCount_ : 0; }
};
```

---

**10. I:**
Nice! What would you improve if this were production code at Bloomberg or Jump Trading?

**I can also enhance by:
* Adding move semantics to avoid unnecessary increments,
* Useing a separate control block struct with deleter and allocator support,
* thread safety if shared across threads,
* Adding custom deleter support,
* Useing `std::atomic<int>` for ref count in multithreaded environments.
* A **full compilable implementation**,
* A **test driver file**,
* Or an **enhanced version with move semantics and custom deleters**.

### âœ… **Output Example**

When you run `./test_shared_ptr` you should see:

```
Foo(42) constructed
Hello from Foo(42)
Foo(99) constructed
Hello from Foo(99)
Foo(99) destroyed
Foo(42) destroyed
All tests passed.
```

further enhancements can be to:
* Add **thread-safe ref counting** with `std::atomic<int>`,
* Add **custom deleters**,
* Add **weak pointer support**.

### Verification of Answers

**1. What is the primary purpose of a `SharedPtr<T>` smart pointer?**  
**Your Answer:** b) To automatically manage the lifetime of a heap-allocated object via reference counting  
**Correct?** âœ… **Yes**  
**Explanation:** A `SharedPtr` manages the lifetime of a heap-allocated object by using reference counting to track how many pointers share ownership. When the reference count reaches zero, the object is deleted, preventing memory leaks. Option a is incorrect because exclusive ownership is the role of `unique_ptr`. Option c is unrelated, and option d is not guaranteed without specific thread-safety mechanisms.

**2. Why is a separate `int* refCount_` used instead of an `int refCount_` in the `SharedPtr` implementation?**  
**Your Answer:** a) To allow multiple `SharedPtr` instances to share the same reference count  
**Correct?** âœ… **Yes**  
**Explanation:** The `int* refCount_` is a pointer to a shared integer that all `SharedPtr` instances managing the same object point to. This ensures that all instances update the same reference count, maintaining correct ownership semantics. Option b is incorrect because a pointer doesnâ€™t inherently reduce memory usage. Option c is irrelevant without atomic operations, and option d is incorrect because the reference count is heap-allocated.

**3. What happens if a `SharedPtr` is copied without incrementing the reference count?**  
**Your Answer:** b) The managed object may be deleted prematurely, causing undefined behavior  
**Correct?** âœ… **Yes**  
**Explanation:** Failing to increment the reference count during copying means the new `SharedPtr` isnâ€™t accounted for in the ownership model. If another `SharedPtr` destructs and decrements the count to zero, the object is deleted, leaving the copied `SharedPtr` with a dangling pointer, leading to undefined behavior. Option a is too specific, option c is incorrect, and option d is not a typical outcome.

**4. In the `SharedPtr` destructor, why is it critical to check if `refCount_` is non-null before decrementing?**  
**Your Answer:** a) To avoid dereferencing a null pointer  
**Correct?** âœ… **Yes**  
**Explanation:** If `refCount_` is null (e.g., for a null `SharedPtr` or after a move/reset), attempting to decrement `*refCount_` would dereference a null pointer, causing undefined behavior. Checking `refCount_` ensures safe operation. Option b is a consequence, not the reason. Option c is unrelated, and option d is irrelevant.

**5. What is the role of the `release()` function in the provided `SharedPtr` implementation?**  
**Your Answer:** b) It safely decrements the reference count and deletes the managed object if necessary  
**Correct?** âœ… **Yes**  
**Explanation:** The `release()` function decrements the reference count and, if it reaches zero, deletes both the managed object (`ptr_`) and the reference count (`refCount_`). This ensures proper cleanup. Option a is incorrect (itâ€™s the opposite), option c is the role of `reset()`, and option d is unrelated.

**6. How does the `SharedPtr` handle self-assignment in the copy assignment operator?**  
**Your Answer:** a) It ignores the operation and returns immediately  
**Correct?** âœ… **Yes**  
**Explanation:** The copy assignment operator checks `if (this != &other)` to detect self-assignment. If true, it returns immediately to avoid unnecessarily releasing and reassigning the same resources, which could lead to errors like deleting the object prematurely. Option b is incorrect because it describes incorrect behavior. Option c is not how it works, and option d is not typical.

**7. What is the effect of calling `reset()` with no arguments on a `SharedPtr`?**  
**Your Answer:** b) It sets the managed pointer and reference count to null, potentially deleting the object  
**Correct?** âœ… **Yes**  
**Explanation:** Calling `reset()` with no arguments calls `release()`, which decrements the reference count and deletes the object if the count reaches zero. It then sets `ptr_` and `refCount_` to `nullptr`. Option a is incorrect, option c is unrelated, and option d is wrong.

**8. Why might the `SharedPtr` implementation include a move constructor?**  
**Your Answer:** a) To prevent unnecessary reference count increments and improve performance  
**Correct?** âœ… **Yes**  
**Explanation:** The move constructor transfers ownership by taking the `ptr_` and `refCount_` from the source `SharedPtr` and setting the sourceâ€™s pointers to null, avoiding the need to increment the reference count as in copying. This improves performance. Option b is incorrect without thread-safety mechanisms, option c is invalid, and option d is unrelated.

**9. What would happen if two `SharedPtr` instances were created with the same raw pointer but different control blocks?**  
**Your Answer:** b) The object would be deleted multiple times, leading to undefined behavior  
**Correct?** âœ… **Yes**  
**Explanation:** If two `SharedPtr` instances manage the same raw pointer with different control blocks (i.e., separate `refCount_` pointers), each will independently decrement its count and delete the object when it reaches zero, leading to multiple deletions and undefined behavior. Option a is incorrect, option c is not possible, and option d is wrong.

**10. What is a key limitation of the provided `SharedPtr` implementation for production use?**  
**Your Answer:** b) It is not thread-safe for shared ownership across threads  
**Correct?** âœ… **Yes**  
**Explanation:** The provided `SharedPtr` uses a plain `int*` for `refCount_`, which is not thread-safe. In a multithreaded environment, concurrent access could lead to race conditions. Option a is not a limitation (smart pointers are for heap objects), option c is handled correctly, and option d is supported.
