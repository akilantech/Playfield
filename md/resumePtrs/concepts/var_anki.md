## What is Value at Risk (VaR) and its role in financial risk management?
* VaR estimates the maximum potential loss of a portfolio over a time period at a confidence level
* Used to assess market risk, comply with regulations (e.g., Basel III), and set capital requirements
* Methods include historical, parametric, and Monte Carlo simulation
* **Example**: A 95% 1-day VaR of $20,000 means a 5% chance of losing more than $20,000 in a day

## How do you calculate historical VaR with an example?
* Collect historical portfolio returns, sort in ascending order, select the percentile for the confidence level
* Multiply the return at the percentile by the portfolio value
* **Example**: For $1M portfolio, 100 daily returns, 95% confidence, 5th worst return = -1.8%. VaR = $1M × 1.8% = $18,000
* **Challenge**: Ensuring sufficient, clean historical data for accurate estimation

## How do you calculate standard deviation for parametric VaR with an example?
* Compute mean return, calculate variance as average of squared deviations, take square root for standard deviation
* Parametric VaR = Portfolio Value × z-score × Standard Deviation
* **Example**: Returns [-1.5%, 0.8%, -0.3%, 2.1%, -2.0%], mean = -0.18%, std dev ≈ 1.675%. For 95% VaR, $1M × 1.645 × 1.675% ≈ $27,554
* **Challenge**: Assumes normal distribution, which may not hold for extreme market events



### What is VaR (Value at Risk)?

**Value at Risk (VaR)** is a risk management metric used to estimate the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence level. It quantifies the maximum expected loss under normal market conditions, helping financial institutions assess market risk and comply with regulations like Basel III. VaR is widely used in trading systems, including those for commodities and cryptocurrencies, as seen in your resume’s context of risk systems at Barclays and Citibank.

- **Explanation**: VaR measures the worst-case loss a portfolio might experience over a specific time horizon (e.g., 1 day) at a confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%). For example, a 95% 1-day VaR of $1 million means there’s a 5% chance the portfolio could lose more than $1 million in a day. VaR can be calculated using methods like historical simulation, variance-covariance (parametric), or Monte Carlo simulation. Historical VaR, relevant to your resume’s mention of sensitivity-based historical simulations for Basel requirements, uses past data to estimate future risk.

### Historical VaR Calculation

Historical VaR uses historical price or return data to estimate potential losses without assuming a specific distribution (e.g., normal). It ranks past portfolio returns and selects the loss at the desired confidence level.

**Sample Scenario**:
- **Portfolio**: $1,000,000 invested in a single stock.
- **Time Horizon**: 1 day.
- **Confidence Level**: 95%.
- **Historical Data**: Daily returns over the last 100 days (in percentage terms):  
  [-1.5%, 0.8%, -0.3%, 2.1%, -2.0%, 1.0%, ..., -1.8%] (simplified to 5 sample returns for illustration: [-1.5%, 0.8%, -0.3%, 2.1%, -2.0%]).

**Step-by-Step Historical VaR Calculation**:
1. **Collect Historical Returns**: Assume 100 daily returns are available. For simplicity, we use 5: [-1.5%, 0.8%, -0.3%, 2.1%, -2.0%].
2. **Sort Returns in Ascending Order**: [-2.0%, -1.5%, -0.3%, 0.8%, 2.1%].
3. **Determine the Percentile for 95% Confidence**: For 100 returns, 95% confidence corresponds to the 5th worst return (5% of 100 = 5). With 5 returns, it’s roughly the worst return (since 5% of 5 is impractical, we use the lowest for illustration).
   - Worst return: -2.0%.
4. **Calculate VaR in Dollar Terms**:
   - Portfolio value: $1,000,000.
   - VaR = Portfolio Value × |Return at Percentile| = $1,000,000 × 2.0% = **$20,000**.
5. **Result**: The 95% 1-day historical VaR is **$20,000**, meaning there’s a 5% chance of losing more than $20,000 in one day.

**Realistic Example (100 Returns)**:
- If you had 100 returns and sorted them, the 5th worst return (e.g., -1.8%) would be used. VaR = $1,000,000 × 1.8% = **$18,000**.

### Standard Deviation Calculation (for Variance-Covariance VaR)

Standard deviation measures the volatility of portfolio returns, often used in the parametric VaR method, which assumes returns follow a normal distribution. It’s relevant for risk systems as it quantifies how much returns deviate from their mean.

**Sample Scenario**:
- Same daily returns: [-1.5%, 0.8%, -0.3%, 2.1%, -2.0%].
- Portfolio value: $1,000,000.
- Confidence Level: 95% (z-score for 95% confidence ≈ 1.645).

**Step-by-Step Standard Deviation Calculation**:
1. **Calculate the Mean Return**:
   - Sum of returns: -1.5 + 0.8 + (-0.3) + 2.1 + (-2.0) = -0.9%.
   - Mean = -0.9% / 5 = **-0.18%**.
2. **Calculate Variance**:
   - For each return, compute (Return - Mean)²:
     - (-1.5% - (-0.18%))² = (-1.32%)² = 0.017424%.
     - (0.8% - (-0.18%))² = (0.98%)² = 0.009604%.
     - (-0.3% - (-0.18%))² = (-0.12%)² = 0.000144%.
     - (2.1% - (-0.18%))² = (2.28%)² = 0.051984%.
     - (-2.0% - (-0.18%))² = (-1.82%)² = 0.033124%.
   - Sum of squared differences: 0.017424 + 0.009604 + 0.000144 + 0.051984 + 0.033124 = 0.11228%.
   - Variance = Sum / (n-1) = 0.11228% / 4 = **0.02807%**.
3. **Calculate Standard Deviation**:
   - Standard Deviation = √Variance = √0.0002807 ≈ **1.675%**.
4. **Calculate Parametric VaR**:
   - For 95% confidence, VaR = Portfolio Value × z-score × Standard Deviation.
   - VaR = $1,000,000 × 1.645 × 1.675% = $1,000,000 × 0.01645 × 0.01675 ≈ **$27,554**.
5. **Result**: The 95% 1-day parametric VaR is **$27,554**.

### Mock Interview Question
- **Question**: How would you implement a historical VaR calculation in a C++ risk system for a commodities portfolio, and what challenges might arise?
- **Answer**: I’d implement historical VaR by retrieving historical price data from a database, calculating daily returns, sorting them, and selecting the percentile corresponding to the confidence level. In C++, I’d use STL vectors for sorting and efficient computation. Challenges include handling missing data, ensuring sufficient historical data for accuracy, and optimizing for real-time performance in high-frequency trading systems. For example, I’d use parallel processing to speed up calculations for large portfolios.
